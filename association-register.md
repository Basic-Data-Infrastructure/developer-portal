The Association Register is a registry run by iSHARE. It contains a list of all authorized participants in the iSHARE scheme. For each participant, it stores their current compliancy status, the interval during which that status applies, its endpoint, a list of Authorization Registries which manage access to the participants, and quite a lot of other information, including legal information, such as agreements.

Via the (parties API-call)[https://dev.ishare.eu/satellite/parties.html#request], clients may access data of a specific party, specified by their EORI-id.
