Basic Data Infrastructure (BDI) helps people in the logistics business share information more easily and efficiently. Think of it like a super-organized library where everyone can quickly find and share the exact information they need without any confusion or delays. BDI sets up clear rules and systems to make sure everyone knows how to share data securely and correctly. It uses smart tools to automatically process information and send alerts when something important happens. By building trust and ensuring security with the help of the iSHARE Trust Framework, BDI makes sure that all the information shared is reliable and safe, helping all parties work together smoothly.

Building trust and ensuring security is comprised of the following aspects:

1. Digital Trust: Ensuring that the data shared is authentic and comes from verified sources.
1. Identity and Access Control: Making sure that only authorized individuals or organizations can access certain information.
1. Secure Data Exchange: Protecting the data during transfer so it cannot be tampered with or intercepted by unauthorized parties.
1. Transparency: Providing clear and open processes so that everyone involved knows how data is handled and can verify its accuracy.
1. Accountability: Keeping track of who accesses and shares data, so there is a record of all transactions, ensuring responsibility and traceability.
