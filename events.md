TODO Very little concrete information so summarizing what's on the BDI page

BDI uses event-driven communication.

Event-driven communication is a new way of sharing information in logistics. Instead of sending messages to inform others when something important happens, companies and government agencies now send a signal or "event" to everyone involved. This event includes basic details (metadata) and a link to the main information source. The receivers then check the metadata and decide if they need to access the full information by following the link.

This method has several benefits. It is efficient because it doesn’t require constant checking for updates (polling) and reduces the load on resources. It is also effective because it easily distributes information to many parties at once, ensuring everyone works with the same accurate data. It helps synchronize activities and maintain control, as only those with proper authentication can access the data, minimizing the risk of misuse. Additionally, the sender can track who accessed the data and who did not.

For event-driven communication to work, it needs clear definitions of events, a way to distribute them, and a system to link events together in sequence. Currently, there are also plans to develop features that allow users to review past events. This approach streamlines information sharing, making the process more efficient, secure, and coordinated.

Events in the logistics world are like important occurrences that trigger the sharing of information. Imagine a ship arriving at a port (an event). When this happens, everyone involved needs to know – like the port workers, the ship’s owners, and the companies waiting for the cargo. This arrival time is shared so everyone can update their plans accordingly. These events act as signals that something important has occurred, prompting the relevant information to be shared automatically among all the parties involved.

In everyday terms, people often talk about milestones or statuses, like when a package is out for delivery or when it has been delivered. These are familiar concepts. However, in logistics, these events are connected to a lot more details, such as the location of the event, the involved parties, and any relevant documents. For example, when a ship docks at a port, it’s linked to the ship’s location, the owner, and the cargo documents. This helps everyone know exactly what has happened and what needs to be done next.

Using a formal event-driven model means that these connections are made in a way that computers can understand and act on automatically. This formalization helps coordinate activities efficiently. For instance, when a buyer sends a purchase order to a seller, this event triggers the start of the order processing. Or when a parcel is delivered, it signals the end of the delivery process. These events, identified by details like what happened, where, when, and why, ensure that all the necessary information is exchanged quickly and accurately, keeping the logistics and supply chain operations running smoothly.
