## Contributing to Our Development Portal

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to our development portal! Your feedback, suggestions, and code contributions are invaluable to us. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, there are many ways you can help improve this project. Below are some guidelines and suggestions on how to get involved.

### 1. Report Issues and Suggest Features

If you've encountered an error in the documentation, found a bug, have a suggestion for a new feature, or see something that could be improved, we encourage you to let us know!

- Improve Documentation: If you have a suggested improvement for the documentation, please create a pull request (explained below) and we'll review it and hopefully accept and deploy it on the website.

- Report Bugs: If you've found a bug, please create an issue on our GitHub issues page. Include as much detail as possible, such as the steps to reproduce the issue, your environment, and any relevant error messages.

- Suggest Features: If you have a feature in mind that would enhance the portal, submit it as a feature request. We welcome ideas that could improve the user experience or add value to the portal.

- Enhancement Ideas: If you think there's an area of the project that could be improved (performance, documentation, user interface, etc.), please let us know.

[ðŸ‘‰ Submit an Issue or Feature Request on GitHub](https://github.com/Basic-Data-Infrastructure/developer-portal/issues)

### 2. Contribute Code via Pull Requests

If you're interested in contributing code, we'd love your help! Here's how you can get started:

- Fork the Repository: Start by forking the project's GitHub repository to your own account.

- Clone Your Fork: Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Basic-Data-Infrastructure/developer-portal.git
```

- Create a Branch: Create a new branch for your changes. We recommend naming your branch after the feature or fix you're working on:

```sh
git checkout -b feature-branch
```

- Make Your Changes: Implement your changes locally. Please ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and includes tests where appropriate.

- Test your changes by generating this website locally.

  This website is build using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  To use Jekyll, install a recent version of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and the following Ruby Gems:

  - jekyll
  - jekyll-remote-theme
  - jekyll-default-layout
  - jekyll-seo-tag

  Run `jekyll serve` and point a browser to   [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

- Commit Your Changes: After making your changes, commit them to your branch with a descriptive commit message:

```sh
git commit -m "Add feature: new awesome feature"
```

- Push to GitHub: Push your changes to your GitHub repository:

```sh
git push origin feature-branch
```

- Adding or Updating Instructions: Clarifying setup instructions, adding missing details, or updating outdated content.

- Creating Tutorials: Writing new tutorials to help users and contributors understand the project better.

- Enhancing Comments: Improving inline code comments to make the codebase easier to navigate.

Documentation contributions can be submitted via pull requests, just like code contributions.
