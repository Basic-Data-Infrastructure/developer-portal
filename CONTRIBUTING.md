## Contributing to Our Development Portal

We’re excited that you’re interested in contributing to our development portal! Your feedback, suggestions, and code contributions are invaluable to us. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just getting started, there are many ways you can help improve this project. Below are some guidelines and suggestions on how to get involved.

### 1. Report Issues and Suggest Features

If you’ve encountered an error in the documentation, found a bug, have a suggestion for a new feature, or see something that could be improved, we encourage you to let us know!

	•	Improve Documentation: If you have an suggested improvement for the documentation, please create a pull request (explained below) and we'll review it and hopefully accept it and deploy it on the website.
	•	Report Bugs: If you’ve found a bug, please create an issue on our GitHub issues page. Include as much detail as possible, such as the steps to reproduce the issue, your environment, and any relevant error messages.
	•	Suggest Features: If you have a feature in mind that would enhance the portal, submit it as a feature request. We welcome ideas that could improve the user experience or add value to the portal.
	•	Enhancement Ideas: If you think there’s an area of the project that could be improved (performance, documentation, user interface, etc.), please let us know.
